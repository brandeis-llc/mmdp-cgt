Participant 3 says, \"purple block one was thirty so yellow block should be fifty less,\" suggesting that the purple block weighs 30 grams and the yellow block should be 50 grams less than some reference weight.\n\nGiven the previous context, it seems there might have been some confusion or correction in the weights. If we take the statement at face value:\n\n- The purple block weighs 30 grams.\n- The yellow block should be 50 grams less than some reference weight. If we assume the reference weight is the previously mentioned 60 grams, then the yellow block should weigh 10 grams.\n\nHowever, this contradicts the earlier statement that the yellow block weighs 60 grams. To resolve this, we will use the latest provided weights:\n\n- The purple block weighs 30 grams.\n- The yellow block weighs 10 grams (if 50 grams less than 60 grams).\n\nThe updated weights are:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"red\": 10,\n  \"blue\": 10,\n  \"green\": 20,\n  \"yellow\": 10,\n  \"purple\": 30\n}\n```",
