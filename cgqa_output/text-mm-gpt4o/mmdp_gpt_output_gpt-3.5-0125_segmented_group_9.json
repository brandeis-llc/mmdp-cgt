Participant 3 suggested that one of the blocks weighs 60 grams and confirmed that another block weighs 20 grams.\n2. Participant 3 placed the yellow block on the table, and the scale balanced (lean zero), indicating that the blocks on both sides of the scale are equal in weight.\n\nGiven the previous information and this new piece of information, we can update the conclusion as follows:\n\n1. The red block weighs 10 grams (known from the beginning).\n2. The blue block weighs 20 grams (confirmed by Participant 1 and Participant 3).\n3. The green block weighs 10 grams (confirmed by the scale balancing with the yellow block).\n4. The yellow block weighs 10 grams (confirmed by the scale balancing with the green block).\n5. The purple block weighs 60 grams (suggested by Participant 3).\n\nGiven this information, the updated conclusion is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"red\": 10,\n  \"blue\": 20,\n  \"green\": 10,\n  \"yellow\": 10,\n  \"purple\": 60\n}\n```",
